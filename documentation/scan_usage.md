# Interactive (Segmented, Continuous)

Set up a localhost however you do that, to view `/scan/scan.html`. BY default, this points to the segmented version. For the continuous playback version, scroll to the \<script\> tag at the bottom of the file. Comment out the one that points to `scan_segmented.js`, and uncomment the one that points to `scan_continuous.js`.

The default keybinds for both interactive prototypes are up/down arrow keys to move up and down through the image, and spacebar to mute or restart playback.

Keybinds and, for the "segemnted" version, number of segments, can be changed by editing global variables in the appropriate .js file. One of my TODO's is to make that configurable from the web page.

# Static

Set up a localhost however you do that, to view `/scan/static_prototype/scan_static.html`.
