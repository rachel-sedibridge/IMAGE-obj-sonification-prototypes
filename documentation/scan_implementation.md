# Important note
This is still kind of a "wizard of Oz" prototype, in that it does not programmatically generate the sonification. It uses pre-set audio files which I edited manually (in Reaper) to edit the volume over the course of the track.

This prototype just plays those audio clips (one per region) simultaeously and according to user input.

For how to go about editing the sounds programmatically, the implementation of "echo" should give some ideas.


# Segmented
This prototype has not implemented the more complex UI features implemented in the coninuous sound version: playing individual sounds on their own, and selecting specific regions to play in the sonification.

## Global variables
There are a lot of global variables and I'd like to get rid of some of them, but haven't had time yet.

The things that are meant to be configurable are separated as variables at the top of the file, to make changing them easier. These are:
- `MOVE_UP`, `MOVE_DOWN`, `TOGGLE_PLAY` (str): names (**as set in KeyboardEvents library**) of the keys that trigger moving up nd down within the sonification, and play/pause
- `NUM_SEGMENTS` (int): number of segments to divide the sonification into. **Defaults to 4**.
- `LOOPS` (boolean): whether each segment loops or just plays once. **Defaults to true**.

The URLs for the sound clips are also kept in variables at the top of the file. These are:
- the "start" and "end" voice clips (generated by a free [text-to-speech site](https://ttsmp3.com/)). 
- the edited files for each region (`[region]_real_tone`)
- the unedited stock sounds for each region (`[region]_eg_tone`)

Finally, there are a couple global variables that are referenced by several functions or across function calls, and using a global variable was simplest. These are:
- `regions_to_play`: dict of `{[region name]: [ [audio file url], [selected?] ]}`. The last (`selected?`) is not currently used in this prototype, because it's for one of the UI features not implemented yet. It has been left in order to make it easier to implement those later.
- `sgmt_tracker` (= 0): tracks which segment it's on. Starts at 0 ("start").
- `PLAYERS`: array of the Tone.Player objects for all the regions.
